### Research Engineer | LLM Safety & Reliability
   
   Currently researching LLM evaluation consistency and inference reliability.
   
   **Recent work:**
   - [Safety Stability Index](https://github.com/erikl2/safety-refusal-stability) — 18-28% of safety prompts flip between refuse/comply on random seed
   - [vLLM Failure Modes](https://github.com/erikl2/vllm-failure-modes) — GPU memory threshold analysis for inference reliability
